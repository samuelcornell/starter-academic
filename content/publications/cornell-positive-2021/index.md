abstract: "Issue addressed To investigate whether Australians have experienced any
  positive effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods National online longitudinal
  survey. As part of a June 2020 survey, participants (n = 1370) were asked ‘In your
  life, have you experienced any positive effects from the COVID-19 pandemic’ (yes/no)
  and also completed the World Health Organisation-Five well-being index. Differences
  were explored by demographic variables. Free-text responses were thematically coded.
  Results Nine hundred sixty participants (70%) reported experiencing at least one
  positive effect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living with others (P = .045) and
  employment situation (P textless .001) at baseline (April) were associated with
  experiencing positive effects. Individuals working for pay from home were more likely
  to experience positive effects compared to those who were not working for pay (aOR
  = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.63, P textless .001) or who were working for pay outside
  the home (aOR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.58, P textless .001). 54.2% of participants
  reported a sufficient level of well-being, 23.2% low well-being and a further 22.6%
  very low well-being. Of those experiencing positive effects, 945/960 (98%) provided
  an explanation. The three most common themes were ‘Family time’ (33%), ‘Work flexibility’
  (29%) and ‘Calmer life’ (19%). Conclusions A large proportion of participants reported
  positive effects resulting from changes to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic
  in Australia. So what The needs of people living alone, and of those having to work
  outside the home or who are unemployed, should be considered by health policymakers
  and employers in future pandemic preparedness efforts."
