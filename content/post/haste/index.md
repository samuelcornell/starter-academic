People’s lives in the modern world are perhaps busier than at any other point in human history. Many people go through their own lives in great haste, apparently never even truly knowing themselves. 

Yet paradoxically, boredom is a complaint of many. Many people find boredom and tedium in their daily lives, especially those who work in banal office type jobs. 

I believe that the reason behind this is one of a lack of meaning. 

The modern world has developed within the psyche of its inhabitants one of ‘work sets you free’. Perhaps not coincidentally this being inscribed above the entrance to Auschwitz to maybe motivate its prisoners to do the Nazis dirty deeds all the while unknowing that their fates were already sealed.

Doing hard work (and lots of it) has become synonymous with ‘being a good person’, an ‘honest, hard worker’, trustworthy and such. But I determine this to be a mentality transcribed into our minds from a young age by that of a machine, the military-industrial complex, which requires its cogs and gears to work hard, unquestionably for the good of those in charge of it. 

People working hard do not question their own lives and do not question their own lack of meaning or purpose. They simply do.

Comment 4 perhaps perpetuates this phenomenon in its announcement that at its best work is more fun than fun. I am not entirely sure I agree but I believe it depends on the context and the underlying motivation behind the work.

Work can indeed be fun. If work is being driven by the autonomous individual and has a clear purpose and is also not unnecessarily difficult or trivial then work can instigate in a person wonderful sensations such as flow which cannot be found in hedonistic past times.

But if work is insidious in its nature, existing for the pursuits of someone else and with no meaning then it is disastrous for the human psyche. 

I believe this is why people are easily bored. Boredom sets in when a person does not even know what drives them or what they like. They only know how to perform for someone else. They do not know themselves. They are totally co-dependent, in the most detrimental manner. 

These points are perhaps what T.S Eliot was alluding to in his comment of people in the modern world being distracted from distraction by distraction. Distraction can be wonderful if it is brought about natural. For instance a lively mind wandering whilst in nature on a long walk or while making someonthing out of wood and pondering some philosophical question. 

But today people find themselves distracted by life’s artificially created beaurocratic tedium. 
In a sense William Henry Davies was alluding to these tribulations in his wonderful poem ‘Leisure’. We have no time to stand and stare is a well-known line of this poem and is perhaps truer now than ever. 

Why then are we bored. Busy and bored?!

Comment 1 alludes to a feeling of personal responsibility. If you are bored, then it is your own fault. True. Every man has it in himself the power to change absolutely anything that he may desire about himself and no more. If we are bored, we must instigate the change. We must find the drive and the motivation and realise that it is only up to use. I think that the line, ‘seen in the right way, everything can be a ritual, and everything can have meaning’ is a wonderful attitude for living. But this may be a difficult thing to achieve for those that know no different than performing like a robot for some other. 

At the opposite end of the spectrum comment 5 claims that individuals unable to relax are a pain to themselves and a pain to others. I can see how this may be. However, these individuals are often the ones driving change in society. Restless activists, idealists, that cannot sit still while a problem is known. These individuals are necessary and important. But everyone must know that they have it within themselves to at any moment drop out of reality, go within themselves and find contentment.
