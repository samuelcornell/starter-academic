Humour is strange, and we wonder why we can laugh at such a wide array of circumstances. Humans can find humour in many things and label it with different names such as comedy, satire, irony and others. This is perhaps why it may be seen as a dark mystery to some. 

It seems apparent that humour is unique among our own species and that is has evolved as a method of communication and social cohesion. Humans use humour to ease tensions and they also use humour to simply have fun. It used with new members of a group and it used amongst old friends. 

Perhaps a primary reason for the evolution of humour among humans is its ability to relieve one of suffering. This is what Gandhi is referring to in his comment about suicide. The Royal Marines have a similar credence, ‘cheerfulness in the face of adversity’. Humour enables people to continue their strife and their pursuits even in times of challenge. In this way, people may learn to engage in humour through challenge and social pressure. Through different circumstances people are able to hone their humour skill. 

Perhaps this is what Seabury is referring to when declaring that humour is not a trait of character but is in fact an art requiring practice. In this sense people such as the Royal Marines surely are well versed in their own humour and that of their comrades by regularly flexing it in times of hardship. 

I believe that humour is necessarily for humans to accomplish many challenged and believe it must be simply necessary for survival. Meaning in one’s life is the probably the most essential matter that one must come to terms with but humour surely adds meaning to the chaos which we are thrust into. 

It is conceivable that it is this essential nature of humour and its skill which is required amongst men that many will not own up to their lack of it. It may be that a lack of humour is not only shameful but counterproductive to the cooperation of a group. Seeing as group cooperation is one of the defining factors of being human, a lack of humour is maybe an act of treason against nature herself. It may well be ones own duty to develop their own humour to appropriate levels to be sophisticated enough to be a man amongst men.
