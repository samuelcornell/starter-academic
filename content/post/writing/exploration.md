The human species has always innately desired to explore. We have always craved exploration and aimed to cross new frontiers. Perhaps It is this natural curiosity which enabled our species to leave its birthplace of Africa to move great distances across lands into new parts of the world.

Our hunger for progression and our natural curiosity has caused us many problems throughout our history but has also enabled us to amass a species now 7 billion strong. Problems along the way have included but are not limited to, mass epidemics, famine and plague as well as dictatorships and slavery, and great mechanised wars. 

However, our curiosity has also enabled us to fight against these problems and produce scientific and technological advancement such as finding penicillin. It is this which I believe Wernher von Braun is referring to in his comment about the expansion of our knowledge from space travel, through difficult and arduous missions we are able to discovery new ways of solving problems and also new ways of advancing our species. 

In the moment, our strife can seem all but too great and may seem futile. But in years to come our hard-won knowledge born from discovery may help us to solve future problems that we didn’t know exist or do not yet have in the present. For the human animal it could be said that “Life without knowledge is death in disguise”. It seems apparent that we will also aim to explore outside of out boundaries and defy our own perceived limitations.

Therefore, I do agree with the comment that ‘Human beings need a challenge and space exploration is the biggest adventure of all.’ Space travel is the epitome of the unknown and our species has the propensity to look into the unknown to see what is on the other side.

Furthermore, humans crave challenges. This is exactly what Kennedy was referring to in his comment and this is illustrated by the many challenged that individuals choose to undertake regularly, such as running marathons or other arduous challenged. Humans need to push themselves to their mental and physical limits to feel alive.

Nevertheless, Carl Jung makes the point, almost Buddhist in its interpretation, that it is easier to flee from oneself via space flight than it is to penetrate one’s own being. In many ways this comment make sense and is exemplified by the immense difficulty many people face in meditating or even simply being alone for extended periods of time. It could be argued though, that this is because humans have evolutionarily developed as social creatures that work best when functioning as a group rather than as a solitary unit. Perhaps humans are not supposed to penetrate their own being but do in fact exist to face up to natural challenged while working and communicating together. 

It is hard to speculate and in fact the argument is easily challenged by the vast number of humans who live their lives as monks and similar roles whose aims in life are to want for nothing and resist nothing either, challenges, pain, suffering or any given emotion. 

In this respect, people wanting to unnecessarily push their own limits to pursue a potentially meaningless goal of leaving the home planet maybe seen as superfluous and extreme. I believe the last comment is referring to this when talking of facing the great dangers which already exist here on earth and which are largely created by us. 

Maybe there exists an equilibrium, allowing humans to explore and seek to defy their own limitations but also maintaining awareness and consciousness that everything we could naturally need and want is already within us and here on earth.
